description: With a background in computational linguistics, Maarten has been
  involved in many corpus projects. Over the course of time he has developed the
  TEITOK environment, which is intended to allow linguists to build, maintain,
  and improve their own corpus without the need for extensive computational
  skills.  Maarten is currently employed at the Institute of Formal and Applied
  Linguistics, Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, at Charles University

  environment, which is intended to allow linguists to build, maintain, and
  improve their own corpus without the need for extensive computational skills.
  Modern corpora can contain much more information than just text, and the
  development of the environment is a constant attempt to see how all this
  information can best be made available. Maarten is currently employed at the
