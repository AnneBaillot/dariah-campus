  Michal, a mathematician by background, did his Ph.D. in Linguistics at Charles
  University in Prague, Czech Republic. Building, editing, annotating, and
  querying text corpora, as well as maintaining, customization and development
  of corpus tools, is his daily business at the Institute of the Czech National
  Corpus – and so is research! Michal has matured along with the institute to
  serve his turn as department head, and he has extensive experience in teaching
  corpus linguistics and basic linguistic programming to humanities students.
