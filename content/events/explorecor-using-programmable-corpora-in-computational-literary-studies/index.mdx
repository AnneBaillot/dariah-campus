abstract: This three-day training school organised by the CLS Infra project
  focused on dynamic collections of literary texts manipulated programmatically.
  Learners will learn to find, evaluate, and select corpora using tools like
  CLSCor and DraCor, and gain skills in Python, Jupyter Notebooks, API querying,
  Linked Open Data, and Digital Literary Network Analysis. The training
  addresses reproducibility using Docker, promoting transparent, replicable
  research in Computational Literary Studies.

about: >-
  ExploreCor: Using Programmable Corpora in Computational Literary Studies” is a
  three-day academic training school, organised by the CLS Infra project, taking
  place in Vienna in from June 10-12, 2024. This intensive program covers some
  of the most important steps in the research cycle of Computational Literary
  Studies, focusing on “Programmable Corpora” – dynamic collections of literary
  texts manipulated programmatically. Participants will delve into finding,
  evaluating, and selecting corpora using tools like the CLSCor metadata
  catalogue and DraCor. The curriculum spans from learning how to use Python and
  Jupyter Notebooks for analysis, querying and retrieving data via APIs to
  working with Linked Open Data and how to conduct Digital Literary Network
  Analysis. Addressing the Reproducibility Crisis, the training school
  introduces Docker for research encapsulation. Attendees gain practical skills
  to conduct transparent and replicable research, contributing to the
  advancement of Computational Literary Studies.

  ## Software Downloads


  ### Gephi


  Download and install  “Gephi” [https://gephi.org](https://gephi.org) 


  ### Docker


  “Docker Desktop": [https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/ ](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)


  After having installed “Docker”, go to [https://github.com/dracor-org/dracor-explorecor](https://github.com/dracor-org/dracor-explorecor) and follow the instructions in the “Setup of a Local DraCor Environment” section. At the end of this process, there should be a local Jupyter Lab instance running under http://localhost:8889
