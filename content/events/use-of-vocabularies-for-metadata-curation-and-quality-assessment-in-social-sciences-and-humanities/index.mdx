abstract: This event, organised in the framework of the TRIPLE project, provided
  insights into the use of “topical vocabularies” and their use in metadata
  curation and quality assessment in the Social Sciences and Humanities (in the
  EOSC context). The sessions introduces learners to have a better understanding
  of the interoperability challenges faced within/by the SSH branch of the EOSC,
  and be familiar with some initiatives related to metadata curation and
  enrichment in the SSH.

  The event "Use of vocabularies for metadata curation and quality assessment in
  social sciences and humanities" was organised as part of the Horizon 2020
  funded project TRIPLE (Grant Agreement No. 863420.).
  https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/863420 The starting point for the
  organisation of this event was to analyse the challenges faced to create the
  multilingual GoTRIPLE vocabulary and compare it with other initiatives
  recently undertaken in the Social Sciences and Humanities branch of the
  European Science Cloud (EOSC) context.


  ## Learning outcomes

  - title: How to use vocabularies to enrich GoTriple ?
    speakers:
      - homo-julien
    body: The GoTriple platform is a discovery service for SSH publications. During
      the ingestion pipeline, it transforms metadata records into the Triple
      Data Model, it performs a series of cleansing, normalization and
      enrichment procedures - in order to deal with metadata heterogeneity,
      increase multilingualism and improve content searchability and
      discoverability - and, finally, it stores and indexes the enriched
      metadata records, making them searchable via the GoTriple search engine.
      During this process, many vocabularies are involved having a strategic
      role in the quality of the results and by extension in the satisfaction of
      the end users of the platform. What are these vocabularies? Where are they
      used and how? What are the difficulties encountered in the framework of
      GoTriple? We will try to answer these questions during the session.

  - title: Multilinguality and the use of vocabularies at Europeana
    speakers:
      - isaac-antoine
    body: Europeana gathers millions of metadata records from over 3500 libraries,
      archives and museums across Europe. Such a diversity with many quality
      issues (sparseness, heterogeneity, multilinguality). We present how
      Europeana and its partners work to address these issues, in a
      collaborative and flexible fashion. The Europeana Data Model paves the way
      for gathering richer metadata, but all parties need to exploit this
      potential. Especially, populating the data model's elements with
      multilingual linked open data vocabularies can bring a lot of value. We
      encourage our partners to publish richer metadata that exploits the
      controlled vocabularies they often already use. We also perform automatic
      metadata enrichment, using a purpose-built linked-data based "entity
      collection" as target. Finally, partners have also embarked on producing
      their own automatic metadata enrichments. In parallel, the Europeana
      network has developed a tier system for the Europeana Publishing
      Framework, which enables measuring and reporting on important aspects of
      metadata quality in the Europeana datasets.

  - title: ARIADNEplus vocabulary mapping strategy
    speakers:
      - binding-ceri
    body: The ARIADNEplus project aggregated over 3.5 million metadata records
      describing archaeological sites. These records were converted and
      integrated to an RDF triple store using a data schema based on the CIDOC
      Conceptual Reference Model (CRM), then exported to an OpenSearch index for
      use with the search portal UI. Search is via 3 major facets - place, time
      and subject. This presentation primarily concerns the subject integration
      work which involved 59 local vocabularies containing over 19,000 subject
      terms in 16 different languages. A vocabulary matching tool allowed each
      data provider to define correctly formatted mappings from their own local
      vocabularies to a central common 'spine' vocabulary (Getty Art &
      Architecture Thesaurus, AAT). Using the resultant mappings, the metadata
      records were enriched with AAT identifiers. The AAT poly-hierarchical
      structure was incorporated into the search system, facilitating both
      multilingual cross search and hierarchical subject expansion. This
      approach led to a noticeable improvement in both recall and precision.

  - title: Vocabularies in the SSH Open Marketplace
    speakers:
      - illmayer-klaus
    body: SSH Open Marketplace
      ([https://marketplace.sshopencloud.eu](https://marketplace.sshopencloud.eu))
      acts as a place to get information on tools, services, training materials,
      publications, datasets, and workflows from the Social Sciences and
      Humanities domain. Users can propose to add new items or to extend the
      information about existing items. SSH Open Marketplace data model operates
      with dynamic fields that can be connected to vocabularies. The
      presentation gives information about the technical background of the
      integration of vocabularies and shares experiences with this approach. On
      the “SSH vocabs commons” project the used vocabularies of the SSH Open
      Marketplace are represented. Ideas on how to further develop the “SSH
      vocabs commons” project are discussed from the perspective of the SSH Open
      Marketplace.

  - title: Vocabularies and quality improvement of library catalogues
    speakers:
      - király-péter
    body: "QA catalogue is a metadata quality assessment tool developed for MARC21
      and PICA metadata schema based library catalogues. Catalogues use
      vocabularies internally for recording their own structure and the terms
      particular data elements might contain, and externally for enhancing the
      descriptive data elements. This latter category covers two main areas:
      subject indexing and normalisation of (personal, family, corporate,
      geographical) names, titles and events. The tool reads MARC or PICA files
      (in different formats), analyses some quality dimensions, and saves the
      results into CSV files."
