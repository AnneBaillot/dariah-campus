abstract: This event, organised in the framework of the TRIPLE project, provided
  insights into the use of “topical vocabularies” and their use in metadata
  curation and quality assessment in the Social Sciences and Humanities (in the
  EOSC context). The sessions introduces learners to have a better understanding
  of the interoperability challenges faced within/by the SSH branch of the EOSC,
  and be familiar with some initiatives related to metadata curation and
  enrichment in the SSH.

    body: The GoTriple platform is a discovery service for SSH publications. During
      the ingestion pipeline, it transforms metadata records into the Triple
      Data Model, it performs a series of cleansing, normalization and
      enrichment procedures - in order to deal with metadata heterogeneity,
      increase multilingualism and improve content searchability and
      discoverability - and, finally, it stores and indexes the enriched
      metadata records, making them searchable via the GoTriple search engine.
      During this process, many vocabularies are involved having a strategic
      role in the quality of the results and by extension in the satisfaction of
      the end users of the platform. What are these vocabularies? Where are they
      used and how? What are the difficulties encountered in the framework of
      GoTriple? We will try to answer these questions during the session.
