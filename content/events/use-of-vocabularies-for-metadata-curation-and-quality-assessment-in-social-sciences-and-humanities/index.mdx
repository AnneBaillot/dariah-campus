abstract: This event, organised in the framework of the TRIPLE project, provided
  insights into the use of “topical vocabularies” and their use in metadata
  curation and quality assessment in the Social Sciences and Humanities (in the
  EOSC context). The sessions introduces learners to have a better understanding
  of the interoperability challenges faced within/by the SSH branch of the EOSC,
  and be familiar with some initiatives related to metadata curation and
  enrichment in the SSH.

  - title: How to use vocabularies to enrich GoTriple ?
    speakers:
      - homo-julien
    body: The GoTriple platform is a discovery service for SSH publications. During
      the ingestion pipeline, it transforms metadata records into the Triple
      Data Model, it performs a series of cleansing, normalization and
      enrichment procedures - in order to deal with metadata heterogeneity,
      increase multilingualism and improve content searchability and
      discoverability - and, finally, it stores and indexes the enriched
      metadata records, making them searchable via the GoTriple search engine.
      During this process, many vocabularies are involved having a strategic
      role in the quality of the results and by extension in the satisfaction of
      the end users of the platform. What are these vocabularies? Where are they
      used and how? What are the difficulties encountered in the framework of
      GoTriple? We will try to answer these questions during the session.

  - title: Multilinguality and the use of vocabularies at Europeana
    speakers:
      - isaac-antoine
    body: Europeana gathers millions of metadata records from over 3500 libraries,
      archives and museums across Europe. Such a diversity with many quality
      issues (sparseness, heterogeneity, multilinguality). We present how
      Europeana and its partners work to address these issues, in a
      collaborative and flexible fashion. The Europeana Data Model paves the way
      for gathering richer metadata, but all parties need to exploit this
      potential. Especially, populating the data model's elements with
      multilingual linked open data vocabularies can bring a lot of value. We
      encourage our partners to publish richer metadata that exploits the
      controlled vocabularies they often already use. We also perform automatic
      metadata enrichment, using a purpose-built linked-data based "entity
      collection" as target. Finally, partners have also embarked on producing
      their own automatic metadata enrichments. In parallel, the Europeana
      network has developed a tier system for the Europeana Publishing
      Framework, which enables measuring and reporting on important aspects of
      metadata quality in the Europeana datasets.
