abstract: This event, organised in the framework of the TRIPLE project, provided
  insights into the use of “topical vocabularies” and their use in metadata
  curation and quality assessment in the Social Sciences and Humanities (in the
  EOSC context). The sessions introduces learners to have a better understanding
  of the interoperability challenges faced within/by the SSH branch of the EOSC,
  and be familiar with some initiatives related to metadata curation and
  enrichment in the SSH.
