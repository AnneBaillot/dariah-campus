  Keen to get a flying start in Digital Humanities?


  You can build, edit, annotate, and query a text corpus without a single line of code!


  Structure texts with the XML-TEI.


  Run an NLP tool to add linguistic information.


  Tackle real research questions concerning Shakespeare’s dramas or your own data by mastering CQL and Universal Dependencies.


  You will be able to experience these discipline-wide standards hands-on in TEITOK , KonText,  and UDPipe .

about: This training school is the first held by the CLS-Infra project.
prep: >-
  **What do I bring to prepare for the training?**


  Corpus building is an integral part of this workshop. Therefore, we ask you to bring _a few text files of your own interest_ for your individual hands-on experience with building a corpus. These files do not necessarily have to be in English.


  **Who is this course for?**


  This is an elementary course for actual beginners. If you have any NLP/programming skills,  if you have ever built your own corpus or queried one beyond looking for a single word, or if you are well-versed in XML-TEI, this course would be too slow for you.


  If you do have prior experience with the skills offered in this training school, you might still have fun scrolling through the teaching materials or apply for a fellowship to pursue your individual research or teaching project with the on-site support by our [CLS INFRA project partners](https://clsinfra.io/opportunities/tnafellowships/).

sessions:
  - title: Intro - Information extraction from the Shakespeare Drama Corpus
    body: "We use the Shakespeare Drama Corpus to show you how to extract
      information with corpus-linguistic methods: which questions you can ask
      and what answers you can expect. This is a general overview; you will
      learn details of the individual tools and methods in the following
      sessions."
    speakers:
      - cinková-silvie
  - title: XML, TEI, and TEITOK I
    speakers:
      - janssen-maarten
    body: This session introduces the basic principles of the XML markup and
      presents the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI-XML) guidelines as an encoding
      standard for digital editions and textual corpora. The students produce a
      valid TEI-XML document and upload it to TEITOK, our web-based platform for
      viewing, creating, and editing corpora with both rich textual mark-up and
      linguistic annotation.
  - title: Universal Dependencies – Morphology
    speakers:
      - cinková-silvie
    body: This session presents UDPipe, an NLP tool to analyze texts in more than
      seventy languages. UDPipe works with Universal Dependencies. Universal
      Dependencies is a framework for consistent grammar annotation across human
      languages. We particularly focus on its morphological annotation scheme,
      explaining the individual part-of-speech labels, as well as the more
      fine-grained morphological features, on English. A separate session deals
      with the syntactic markup.
  - title: Base CQL
    speakers:
      - křen-michal
    body: CQL (Corpus Query Language, developed in the 1990s) is the de facto
      standard in the field, used by the most current corpus query tools. We
      start with explaining the students the regular expressions and gradually
      and diverse restrictions within a single token query. We demonstrate the
      searches in Kontext, the corpus manager developed and maintained by the
      Institute of the Czech National Corpus.
  - title: Metadata
    speakers:
      - janssen-maarten
    body: This session explains the TEI-XML header structure, its relation to the
      document body, good practice and its implementation in TEITOK. It prepares
      the students for setting up their own corpus of philological texts with
      complex headers and genre-specific text metadata. The students receive
       guidance to create their own document headers.
  - title: Advanced CQL
    speakers:
      - křen-michal
    body: This session is a continuation of the Base CQL session. It draws on
      queries about individual tokens and proceeds to queries on a sequence of
      tokens, introducing the concept of group referencing and metadata scope
      (e. g. within a single sentence). It also introduces aggregation and
      filtering functionalities of Kontext, the corpus manager used in the
      demonstration.
  - title: Statistics
    speakers:
      - cvrček-václav
    body: This session explains statistical considerations on frequency in corpus
      linguistics, mainly the statistical significance and effect size of a
      difference between two frequency counts. Besides, it introduces several
      quantitative stylistics metrics, such as different flavors of lexical
      richness, descriptivity vs. narrativity, thematic concentration, and
      thematic weights of individual words. Students learn about the on-line
      tools Calc and QuitaUp to calculate these metrics automatically.
  - title: Universal Dependencies – Syntax
    speakers:
      - cinková-silvie
    body: This is a continuation of the Universal Dependencies – Morphology session.
      It explains the principles of dependency grammar and its UD flavor,
      touching upon the interplay between the linguistic form and function, as
      well as ambiguity and vagueness in the linguistic annotation. We explain
      the principles of dependency grammar and elaborate on the most common
      syntactic labels and their typical usage.
  - title: Named-Entity Recognition and bulk editing
    body: In this session, students gain the basic overview of the state of the art
      in the Named-Entity Recognition and Entity Linking (referring from a
      linguistic entity to an external knowledge base). They learn about the
      main Entity Linking authorities, such as WikiData and VIAAF. They get a
      hands-on experience with TEITOK’s manual entity annotation module.
      Eventually, they get acquainted with TEITOK’s bulk editing module.
    speakers:
      - janssen-maarten
  - title: Tree queries - Grew
    speakers:
      - cinková-silvie
    body: "This session teaches the students the foundations of Grew, a declarative
      tree query language, working with its implementation in TEITOK. We
      demonstrate the power of tree querying on searching the syntactically
      parsed Shakespeare corpus for salient semantic participants of a verb:
      which grammatical constructions to look for and how to implement the
      search in Grew."
