abstract: The first of the three proposed workshops, WS1, of the NOS-HS project
  "Linking, Building, and Sustaining Humanities Digital Spatial Infrastructures
  for Research in the Nordic Countries" has the thematic focus “Spatial data
  medieval to modern” and in this workshop, we introduce the three work packages
  through keynote lectures and explorative sessions. The main aims of WS1 are to
  define key concepts (spatial infrastructures, LOD, metadata, ontology),
  outline major challenges in the field, and to provide an opportunity to share
  experiences of addressing the issues in individual and national projects
  across the Nordic countries.

about: "The keynote lectures were produced as outputs from the workshop Spatial
  data medieval to modern held in Uppsala May 30 - 1 June 2022. The lectures
  cover key concepts in the field of (spatial) digital research infrastructures
  in the Humanities such as spatial infrastructures, LOD, metadata, ontology
  etc., outline major challenges in the field and give some concrete, authentic
  examples of how to overcome at least some of them in small- and large-scale
  projects in both academia and the GLAM sector. Lecture 1 Keeping a Sense of
  Perspective: Spatial Data Infrastructure and the Humanities by Leif Isaksen;
  Lecture 2 Linked Open Cultural Heritage Data: LOD and RDF in theory and
  practice by Marcus Smith; Lecture 3 The World Historical Gazetteer: Common
  metadata principles and common vocabulaties and ontologies by Ruth Mostern."
