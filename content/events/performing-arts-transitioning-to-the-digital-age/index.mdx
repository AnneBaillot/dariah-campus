  The transition process of cultural and artistic institutions, associations and individual artists to digital communication, which has been going on for several decades, has recently been further accelerated by various factors such as the pandemic or digital transformations of state institutions. Digital communication in the field of art, in addition to everyday, professional and administrative communication, which also includes promotional activities, encompasses shaping and presenting artistic work with the help of digital technologies and, afterward, digital processing and storage of administrative and archival material.


  Performing arts, which are considered intangible cultural heritage, are particularly difficult to adapt to this situation precisely because their value is largely manifested as the totality of all tangible elements (scenography, costume design, dramatic text, lighting, etc.), which at a specific moment in conjunction with the audience create a unique and intangible experience and expression. Extensive use of digital technology and communication platforms for theatrical performance implies a radical change in the communication code and requires a major adaptation of previously acquired and established knowledge. It also requires the acquisition of new knowledge, which is often not closely related to the arts and humanities.


  The conference aimed to examine the possibilities of interdisciplinary connecting information sciences and computer science with the performing arts in the context of digital humanities while reflecting on the achievements so far on this path. Therefore, through three thematic blocks it was shown, among other things, how digital humanities tools can serve scholars in performing arts research, what is the relationship between digital technologies and theatrical performance and, finally, what are the possibilities of digital archiving and linking data on performing arts material on both national and international level. At the same time, the conference introduced members of the national theatre community, i.e. performing arts and theatre (i.e. performance) studies with leading international scholars and experts in the field.

      The research projects in digital humanities and digital theatre studies
      “L’École du Spectateur” and “Visual Staging”, jointly led by La Rochelle
      Université, Université de Lille and Université de Poitiers work in
      collaboration with cognitive sciences and neurosciences in order to define
      and/or analyse a number of characteristics of the performing arts that the
      traditional research methods have not been able to detect or measure, such
      as the importance of the venue where the performance takes place, the
      relevance of the joint presence of the audience and the artist during a
      live show or the involvement of the emotions felt by the spectator in the
      appreciation of a performance.

      This conference paper aims to outline the most important issues of the relations between theatre and performance studies and digital phenomena. Its primary goal is to give an overview of the possibilities that digital humanities can offer to theatre and performance studies. It will also raise questions and depict problems that this kind of approach implies, and it will as well try to offer tentative conclusions about the benefits that the encounter between theatre and performance studies on one hand and digital humanities on the other brings. Consequently, the goal is not to come to an obligatory conclusion, but rather to ask questions and provoke discussions that could help contribute to future studies.
