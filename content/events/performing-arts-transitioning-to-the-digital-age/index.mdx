  The transition process of cultural and artistic institutions, associations and individual artists to digital communication, which has been going on for several decades, has recently been further accelerated by various factors such as the pandemic or digital transformations of state institutions. Digital communication in the field of art, in addition to everyday, professional and administrative communication, which also includes promotional activities, encompasses shaping and presenting artistic work with the help of digital technologies and, afterward, digital processing and storage of administrative and archival material.


  Performing arts, which are considered intangible cultural heritage, are particularly difficult to adapt to this situation precisely because their value is largely manifested as the totality of all tangible elements (scenography, costume design, dramatic text, lighting, etc.), which at a specific moment in conjunction with the audience create a unique and intangible experience and expression. Extensive use of digital technology and communication platforms for theatrical performance implies a radical change in the communication code and requires a major adaptation of previously acquired and established knowledge. It also requires the acquisition of new knowledge, which is often not closely related to the arts and humanities.


  The conference aimed to examine the possibilities of interdisciplinary connecting information sciences and computer science with the performing arts in the context of digital humanities while reflecting on the achievements so far on this path. Therefore, through three thematic blocks it was shown, among other things, how digital humanities tools can serve scholars in performing arts research, what is the relationship between digital technologies and theatrical performance and, finally, what are the possibilities of digital archiving and linking data on performing arts material on both national and international level. At the same time, the conference introduced members of the national theatre community, i.e. performing arts and theatre (i.e. performance) studies with leading international scholars and experts in the field.

      The research projects in digital humanities and digital theatre studies “L’École du Spectateur” and “Visual Staging”, jointly led by La Rochelle Université, Université de Lille and Université de Poitiers work in collaboration with cognitive sciences and neurosciences in order to define and/or analyse a number of characteristics of the performing arts that the traditional research methods have not been able to detect or measure, such as the importance of the venue where the performance takes place, the relevance of the joint presence of the audience and the artist during a live show or the involvement of the emotions felt by the spectator in the appreciation of a performance.

      This conference paper aims to outline the most important issues of the relations between theatre and performance studies and digital phenomena. Its primary goal is to give an overview of the possibilities that digital humanities can offer to theatre and performance studies. It will also raise questions and depict problems that this kind of approach implies, and it will as well try to offer tentative conclusions about the benefits that the encounter between theatre and performance studies on one hand and digital humanities on the other brings. Consequently, the goal is not to come to an obligatory conclusion, but rather to ask questions and provoke discussions that could help contribute to future studies.

      Eurokaz was a festival of new theatre that was founded in Zagreb in 1987 and took place until 2013 when it was transformed into a producing house that is still active today. Thanks to a grant from the Kultura Nova Foundation the process of digitization of the festival archive has begun last year. It is a big challenge and we have encountered many problems due to a wide time span which amounts to 27 years of the festival's existence. During this period archiving technology was constantly changing and what we have today is a lot of material in different formats the content of which has to be adjusted to new standards. From press cuttings in paper form to CDs and DVDs, and old websites for each year's program which are not supported anymore (like with Adobe Flash Player), not to mention old video tapes with recorded performances. It is a hefty workload and we assigned an IT expert to create a separate segment on the Eurokaz website, where our archive will be visible to a wider audience.

      In the framework of the DARIAH_EU WG Theatralia compilation project of the International Theatrical Registry, I launched the RADATMAS project at the University of Rome “Tor Vergata” in February 2022. This is a randomized research study of the little town of Macerata and its surrounding area. Thanks to the RADATMAS census thirty-one theatre archives have been discovered, while in the Ministry of Italian Culture (MIC) SIUSA database, there are only three archives. The same goes for the theatres: the census found forty-one theatres out of the twenty-three reported by the MIC. The census of theatres and theatrical archives located in the Macerata area as well as the organization of the collected data was completed in the summer of 2022. In September, a colleague from the AI Department joined the working group to jointly design the database of the Italian Theatres and Archives Registry.

  - title: The Potential of Computer Music in Theatre

      Gordan Kreković 


      Since the first notion of the synergy between computer music and theatre in the 1980s, the potential of complementing these practices with each other has significantly grown along the steep trajectories of technical advancements and the influence of new media, generative art, and resulting aesthetics. In comparison to traditional musical forms, computer music allows previously unreachable levels of automation, control, interaction, and sonic diversity. Techniques like algorithmic composition (using formal rules to create music), data sonification (translating data into sound), live coding (writing computer code that generates music live in front of the audience), automation in multimediality, and various aspects of interactivity open novel opportunities in the context of theatre. This presentation will give a brief overview of predominant practices and trends in computer music with examples of their application to performing arts.

  - title: "Modelling of Theatrical Archives: Use of Linked Data in the
      Machine-Readable Representation of Theatrical Information"

      Vasiliki Kourou


      The aim of the project was to create a virtual encyclopaedic source of theatrical knowledge using Linked (Open) Data in order to include it in a wider network of cultural sources that provide theatrical information, within the framework of the Semantic Web. Using the Digitized Archive of the National Theatre of Greece as the reference archive, I tried enriching it through its semantic interconnections with digital sources that provide relevant knowledge. Some of the most notable existing theatre archives and databases have been researched as well as the users’ informative demands influenced by the types of information that appear in each archive, such as biographies, productions, texts, and interviews. This talk introduces a conceptual model designed to be as adequate as possible to represent theatrical archives and to cover a sufficient range of offered theatrical information. The FRBR model was harmonised with the global CIDOC CRM cultural documentation standard to produce the FRBRoo object-oriented library ontology, with which the final model is partially compatible.
