## S﻿ession 5-8 Preparation Notes

### Software and data

 The most important technical requirement for Day 2 would be [installing R](https://cloud.r-project.org/) and (preferably) [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) (development environment for R that will make things easier). We will use the `stylo` library for most of the day; see [step-by-step introduction](https://computationalstylistics.github.io/stylo_nutshell/#) to stylo for beginners, or the more extensive [HOW TO](https://github.com/computationalstylistics/stylo_howto/blob/master/stylo_howto.pdf).

 In case you don’t / can’t install R and `stylo` locally, there will be an option to run analysis from Colaboratory notebooks, just be aware it will require _more_ coding, not less coding, because of the stylo’s interface that doesn’t work in Colab.

 You are free to bring your own collection of texts to the workshop, but you can find more ready to use plain text fiction collections in various languages on the [Computational Stylistics website](https://computationalstylistics.github.io/resources/).

## Materials

 We will use GDrive folder ([https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1V8KFkDxGpKvYqjbkymqukH1QdjwTJeak?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1V8KFkDxGpKvYqjbkymqukH1QdjwTJeak?usp=sharing)) holds all necessary materials.

 Your options are:-

 - Download it and work locally.
 - Download -> re-upload folder to work in Colabs’ virtual machine with R (or just open the .ipynb notebook, then File -> Save a copy in Drive. It will create a copy of the notebook on your own Drive.)


 To copy folder to your own GDrive, do this:-

 - Download CLS_Madrid_Folder
 - Extract the downloaded .zip
 - Upload the extracted folder back to your GDrive
