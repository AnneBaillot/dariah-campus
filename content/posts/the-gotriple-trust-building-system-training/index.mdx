This webinar is part of the TRIPLE Open Science Training Series.

The training session is dedicated to the GoTriple Trust Building System (TBS) and is led by Maxime Bouillard and Gaël van Weyenbergh, co-founders of MEOH, a nonprofit think-and-do tank established in Brussels which is dedicated to studying how human trust can inform new models of cooperation and governance Their work currently focuses on the development of the TBS, a platform for users to connect to reliable partners. 

The TBS was co-designed through workshops with various stakeholders and will be one of the innovative services of the [GoTriple Discovery Platform](https://www.gotriple.eu/).

In this session, the presenters involve a set of testers from the audience to collect their feedback on their experience in using the TBS. Maxime Bouillard and Gaël van Weyenbergh present the TBS through a short live demonstration to showcase features of the TBS such as the network, the news feed, the group chat, the profile section and notifications to keep track of your network’s activity from users’ GoTriple profile. 

A dedicated time for engaging with the audience in the last part of the session enables other attendees to take part in the discussion, have their questions answered, create a profile on the TBS and start using the application.
