abstract: Word embeddings allow you to analyze the usage of different terms in a
  corpus of texts by capturing information about their contextual usage. Through
  a primarily theoretical lens, this lesson will teach you how to prepare a
  corpus and train a word embedding model. You will explore how word vectors
  work, how to interpret them, and how to answer humanities research questions
  using them.

Word embeddings allow you to analyze the usage of different terms in a corpus of texts by capturing information about their contextual usage. This lesson is designed to get you started with word embedding models. Through a primarily theoretical lens, this lesson will teach you how to prepare a corpus and train a word embedding model. You will explore how word vectors work, how to interpret them, and how to answer humanities research questions using them.

This lesson involves running some Python code: a basic familiarity with Python would be helpful, but no particular technical expertise is required.

## Learning outcomes

After completing this lesson, you will be able to:

- Know what word embedding models and word vectors are, and what kinds of questions we can answer with them
- Create and interrogate word vectors using Python
- Put together the corpus you want to analyze using word vectors
- Understand the limitations of word vectors as a methodology for answering common questions
