abstract: Digital technologies are successfully applied in cultural heritage
  projects supporting digitisation of cultural objects, metadata creation,
  metadata maintenance, creation of digital infrastructure for cultural heritage
  research and many others. When we discuss archival digital textual content,
  some of the most imminent tasks are related to automatic metadata generation,
  searchability and preservation, and these can be helped by services for
  automatic semantic annotation. In this blog we discuss the applicability of
  such services for automatic extraction of person names and locations from Oral
  History Transcripts provided by the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum
  (USHMM). The algorithms for automatic information extraction can work with
  comparatively high accuracy when applied in a close domain, they are
  especially helpful and could greatly speed up the human work when large
  volumes of data are to be processed.

### **Person Extraction Service**

The automatic extraction of persons’ names in the EHRI textual resources is an important task for Holocaust digital research. Being able to automatically identify persons’ names allows for:

- automatic metadata enrichment of the available resources and thus for better semantic indexing and search;
- improved document retrieval for specific people;
- better research related to groups of people affected by the Holocaust;
- automated names authority list creation, etc.
