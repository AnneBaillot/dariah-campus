  This resource offers a starting point to learn more about the different types
  of multidimensional media, as well as managing media in a way which promotes
  the FAIR principles.

  The resource also introduces the concept of a Virtual Research Environment to support retrieval and curation of multidimensional data for storytelling via interoperable frameworks.

## **Learning Outcomes**

After completing this course, learners will:

- Define the different types of multidimensional media.
- Recognise the advantages of delivering and retrieving multidimensional content over the web via URLs and PIDs.
- Reflect on FAIR and CARE principles and their application on digital heritage research data.
- Understand the usefulness of Virtual Research Environments (VRE) and deploy VREs to support retrieval and curation of multidimensional data for storytelling via interoperable frameworks.
