abstract: Topic modelling is a technique by which documents within a corpus are
  clustered based on the manner in which certain groups of terms are used
  together within the text. The commonalities between such term groupings tend
  to form what we would normally call “topics”, providing a way to automatically categorise documents by their structural content.  This resource aims to walk readers through the process of topic modelling in Python.

Topic modelling is a technique by which documents within a corpus are clustered based on the manner in which certain groups of terms are used together within the text. The commonalities between such term groupings tend to form what we would normally call “topics”, providing a way to automatically categorise documents by their structural content, rather than any *a priori* knowledge system. Topic modelling is generally most effective when a corpus is large and diverse, so the individual documents within in are not too similar in composition. In EHRI we focus on the Holocaust, so documents available to us are naturally restricted in scope. It was an interesting experiment, however, to test to what extent a corpus of Holocaust-related documents was able to be topic modelled, and what “topics” emerged within it.

The specific type of topic modelling covered in this resource is called Latent Dirichlet Allocation (Blei et al., 2003).

This notebook aims to walk readers through the process of topic modelling in Python and accompanies the article (to be) published in the European Holocaust Research Infrastructure (EHRI) Document Blog entitled "Exploratory Topic Modelling in Python".
