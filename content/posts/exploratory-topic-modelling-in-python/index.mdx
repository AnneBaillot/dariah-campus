abstract: Topic modelling is a technique by which documents within a corpus are
  clustered based on the manner in which certain groups of terms are used
  together within the text. The commonalities between such term groupings tend
  to form what we would normally call “topics”, providing a way to automatically
  categorise documents by their structural content, rather than any a priori
  knowledge system. Topic modelling is generally most effective when a corpus is
  large and diverse, so the individual documents within in are not too similar
  in composition.

This notebook aims to walk readers through the process of topic modelling in Python and accompanies the article (to be) published in the European Holocaust Research Infrastructure (EHRI) Document Blog entitled "Exploratory Topic Modelling in Python".

The transcripts that form the corpus in this tutorial were obtained through the [United States Holocaust Memorial Museum](https://www.ushmm.org/) (USHMM).

Topic modelling is a technique by which documents within a corpus are clustered based on the manner in which certain groups of terms are used together within the text. The commonalities between such term groupings tend to form what we would normally call “topics”, providing a way to automatically categorise documents by their structural content, rather than any a priori knowledge system. Topic modelling is generally most effective when a corpus is large and diverse, so the individual documents within in are not too similar in composition. In EHRI, of course, we focus on the Holocaust, so documents available to us are naturally restricted in scope. It was an interesting experiment, however, to test to what extent a corpus of Holocaust-related documents was able to be topic modelled, and what “topics” emerged within it.

The specific type of topic modelling we’re looking at is called latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), subject of an influential paper by Blei et al. (2003).
