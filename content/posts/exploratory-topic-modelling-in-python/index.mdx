abstract: Topic modelling is a machine-learning technique that finds patterns in language use within a corpus of documents, and clusters those documents accordingly allowing for further analysis.  Using resources held with EHRI's collections, this notebook offers learners an introduction 'LDA' topic modelling using Python in a step-by-step guide.

Topic modelling is a machine-learning technique that finds patterns in language use within a corpus of documents, and clusters those documents accordingly.   The commonalities in ther patterns form “topics”, providing a way to automatically categorise documents by their structural content. The specific type of topic modelling covered in this resource is called Latent Dirichlet Allocation - 'LDA'(Blei et al., 2003).

This EHRI notebook walks readers through the process of topic modelling transcripts obtained through the [United States Holocaust Memorial Museum](https://www.ushmm.org/) (USHMM) using Python and accompanies the article published in the European Holocaust Research Infrastructure (EHRI) Document Blog entitled "Exploratory Topic Modelling in Python".


## L﻿earning outcomes

A﻿fter viewing this training resource, users will be able to:

- Understand the basic concepts of Topic Modelling
- Walk through the process of topic modelling in Python.
