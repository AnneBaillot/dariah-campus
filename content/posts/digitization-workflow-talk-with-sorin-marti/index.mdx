  Jane Haller, a sociologist, digital project manager, and president of the
  Digitales Schaudepot, is in conversation with Sorin Marti. Sorin has a
  background in software engineering, is a master's student in History and
  Digital Humanities, and works as a data steward at the Research and
  Infrastructure Support of the University of Basel.


  As a winning project of the Dariah Theme Call 2022-2024 on Workflows, we evaluated a showcase project called “curiositas5.0”, initiated by the Digitales Schaudepot Association (DSD) it is intended to assist in planning projects and, above all, avoiding unwanted missteps. Keep in mind that each project is distinct and may necessitate alternative measures.


  To capture voices from the community and provide insight into the different working methods, expertise, and backgrounds of the people collaborating on the curiositas5.0 project, we conducted 3 interviews.
