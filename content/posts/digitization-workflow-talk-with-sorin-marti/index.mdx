THIS SHOULD DESCRIBE WHAT IS COVERED IN THE PODCAST

As a winning project of the Dariah Theme Call 2022-2024 on Workflows, we evaluated a showcase project called “curiositas5.0”, initiated by the Digitales Schaudepot Association (DSD) intended to assist in planning projects and, above all, avoid unwanted missteps. 

Jane Haller, a sociologist, digital project manager, and president of the Digitales Schaudepot, is in conversation with Sorin Marti. Sorin has a background in software engineering, is a master's student in History and Digital Humanities, and works as a data steward at the Research and Infrastructure Support of the University of Basel
