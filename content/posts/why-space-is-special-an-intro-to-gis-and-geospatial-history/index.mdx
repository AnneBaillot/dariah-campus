## Introduction

We exist in space. This is useful for us: things would be much more difficult if we did not exist. This means a lot of things, but one simple one is that we have a sense of space. This does not mean that we can all look at a room and think, “Why, that looks like 12.5 square meters!” But it does mean that we can look at a room and think, “This one looks a bit small,” or, “we could fit a shelf here and a desk here.”

## Learning Outcomes:

After completing this resource, learners will be able to:

- better understand the potential and value of a spatial approach to humanities research
- put intuitive grasp in context with regards to GIS mapping 

## Time and Space

We exist in time as well, of course. Yet we are passive in our interactions with time; space we engage with actively. The year 1500 does not feel meaningfully further back in the past than the year 1750, whereas something that is 500 kilometers away feels much further than 250. 

Time and space are, of course, inextricably intertwined. We’ve all had the experience of recommending a restaurant, bar, cafe, or bakery to someone… only to discover that it has been closed for two years. Our suggestion of a place ends up rudely interrupted by the realities of time. The sights one brings people to see around their hometown are very different from standard tourist attractions: This was my favorite park growing up, this was where we hung out after school, this is where my dad and I did trivia to try to win a free cookie. 

This also highlights the distinction between “spaces” and “places”. A space is anywhere; a location. A place is that same location but with meaning. Which is to say: Humans give spaces meaning, and thus create places. This can be used on a societal level or an individual one. Ashgabat, Turkmenistan is certainly a place: it is a city, the capital city. People have lives and families, tell stories and catch up with old friends, break up and play football. Yet for lots of people, it is a dot on a map with no meaning beyond that.

## Intuitive Concepts

The intuitive nature of place and space are a major boon for anyone who works in the field. A significant portion of the methods used in any spatial academic work are scaled up versions of intuitive concepts.

We know that water flows downhill, and that the mountain used to have some different features. What would the path of the river have been before? We know that people do not particularly enjoy walking straight up those same mountains: what route might they have taken? All of this could in concept be answered by a very diligent person on the mountain in question, but what about doing it for a mountain range? Or not for a single path, but to track a whole army? Obviously there are more involved and more complex methods and approaches that can be taken, but at their core is the same truth: they are methods investigating physical space, and we are far more accustomed to interacting with the physical than abstractions.

It is exceedingly hard to lie with space. A fort can have a dozen documents attesting to its peaceful nature, but if it has a few cannons pointed straight at a town, I would believe the gun barrels over reams of paper promises.

## Conclusion

All of these factors - intuitive grasp, the importance of places, and the difficulty in lying - make spatial approaches an extremely valuable tool for reexamining humanities topics. They open up new avenues of investigation and research into old questions and provide new paths of inquiry.

Whether one wants to find out where Frankenstein’s Monster went on his travels, or the likely camp spots for Genghis Khan’s army, spatial approaches are ready to help. 

There are countless tools and techniques and methods out there. And all have their uses and values and benefits. 

But space is special.
