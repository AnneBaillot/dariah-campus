abstract: This is the second of a two-part lesson introducing deep learning
  based computer vision methods for humanities research. This lesson digs deeper
  into the details of training a deep learning based computer vision model. It
  covers some challenges one may face due to the training data used and the
  importance of choosing an appropriate metric for your model. It presents some
  methods for evaluating the performance of a model.

## Learning outcomes

After completing this lesson, you will be able to:

- Interpret what different metrics mean about your model's performance, and to identify where it is performing poorly
- Use data augmentation as a tool for reducing the amount of training data needed to train a machine learning model.
- Understand the complexity of mapping complex or fuzzy concepts onto set categories
