In this tutorial, you learn about the typical methods for obtaining high-quality scanned images, setting the stage for successful text recognition processes. It outlines obtaining digital copies from archives, digitisation needs, and copyright considerations. It also covers using online resources like Google Books and Internet Archive while navigating public domain copyright issues. Lastly, it highlights the Heritage Data Reuse Charter for collaboration between cultural heritage institutions and researchers.

This is the English version of this training module. The video is available with English, French and German subtitles.

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this resource, learners will be able to:

- Recognise the sources for acquiring suitable images for text recognition.
- Assess the quality of images in terms of their suitability for ATR.
- Implement strategies for collecting and organising images for processing.
- Apply basic techniques for scanning and digitizing textual materials.

Whether photographed in an archive or discovered in the digital collections of memory institutions like libraries or museums, for many humanities scholars, images of text sources form the basis of their academic work. Finding, creating and collecting images of textual material is often the first step in the research process. Let us show you some typical ways of acquiring scanned images.

Archives and other memory institutions offer a wealth of material that has not yet been digitized. If you are struggling to obtain digital copies of the documents you are interested in, visiting the institution and requesting the digitization of specific items may be necessary.

As most memory institutions – slowly but surely – move into the digital age, your digitization journey will usually begin in the comfort of your own home, searching through digital finding aids and preparing lists of the relevant institutions and archival materials to request for digital copies.

Once the archival staff has prepared the required files for you, your work of selecting relevant archival materials begins. It is rare that an entire archival folder will be relevant to you. Here, a careful selection might save not only the time of the archivists doing the digitization, but also your wallet.

Most archives and other memory institutions have clearly defined conditions under which digital copies of archival material can be provided and how they can be used. These rules may be part of a general contract between the user and the particular archive, but in the case of a larger digitization project it might be necessary to create a separate contract with project-specific rules.

Digitization of archival materials may be done directly by the user, but often the digitization is carried out by a specialized department within the archive or an external provider. In this case, the user should specify the preferred quality of the digitized material so that it can fit the criteria for the subsequent ATR process. This service is usually chargeable and the final price is based on the number of items digitized.

Once digitization has been done and the resulting scans have been delivered to you, your ATR journey can begin.

Even if visiting an archive might be a great and often joyful opportunity, sometimes sources that have entered the public domain can be found online on the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/) or [Google Books](https://books.google.com/). These sources consist of a collection of scans with an added layer of optical character recognition (OCR) which is, in most cases, not of any usable quality. Both types of data are combined into a PDF that can be downloaded. 

## How about copyright and reuse?

However, it is typically not clearly indicated within Google Books what type of reuse or republication of the digital images is permitted. Instead, the scanned document is preceded by a page that clearly states that the document’s copyright is owned by Google. What does that mean for a source that is in the public domain?

The copyright here refers to the digital object, the image of the scan, not the analogue print, nor the textual content of the source. That means that if you are planning to use only the textual content of the source there is no copyright in your way. Whenever you do need to use or republish the scans there might still be fairly convenient way.
