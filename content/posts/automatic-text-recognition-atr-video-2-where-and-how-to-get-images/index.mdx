abstract: "Discover the foundational steps of Automatic Text Recognition in our
  second tutorial video, focused on acquiring images for ATR. This video
  explores where and how to find, create, and collect images of textual
  material, a crucial initial step in any ATR-based research. Learn about the
  typical methods for obtaining high-quality scanned images, setting the stage
  for successful text recognition processes. "
