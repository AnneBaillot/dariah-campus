## Learning Outcomes

After completing this resource, learners will be able to:

- Recognise the sources for acquiring suitable images for text recognition.
- Assess the quality of images in terms of their suitability for ATR.
- Implement strategies for collecting and organising images for processing.
- Apply basic techniques for scanning and digitizing textual materials.

You can read the blogpost (available in English, French, and German), and watch our video (with subtitles in English, French, and German) embedded in the post. [](https://harmoniseatr.hypotheses.org/332)
