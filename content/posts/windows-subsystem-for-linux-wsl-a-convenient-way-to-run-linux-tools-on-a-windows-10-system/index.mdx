abstract: Linux is a popular operating system and is especially useful for
  projects involving command-line scripts and programming languages such as
  Python. Many tools and examples that are of interest to those wishing to
  explore, experiment,and develop projects for digital humanities or data
  analysis and other tasks are based on Linux. Mac laptops support Linux fairly
  easily, and there are many online resources that a Mac user may find helpful.
  However, until recently, people who have only Windows computers have had a
  relatively difficult time in accessing programs and techniques that require a
  Linux operating system. In the recent past, a common way to operate a Linux
  system on a Windows computer, while continuing to be able to access Windows
  (i.e., without having to reboot the computer into a Linux mode) was through
  installing VirtualBox, followed by installing a Linux operating system into
  the VirtualBox environment. At that point, under VirtualBox, it was not always
  easy or straightforward to configure the Linux system to access network
  resources that are accessible to the Windows system. For most Windows 10
  users, there is now an alternative method of running Linux programs and
  systems, through Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).
