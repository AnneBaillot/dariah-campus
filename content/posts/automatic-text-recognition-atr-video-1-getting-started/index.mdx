This session outlines the entire workflow of humanities research projects utilising ATR to extract full text from scanned images. We provide an overview of each step in the process and introduce subsequent tutorials that delve deeper into these steps. Additionally, a ‘How to get started with ATR’ road map linked below will guide you through important questions and give you basic orientation before starting an ATR project.

## Learning Outcomes

- Identify the components of the ATR workflow relevant to humanities research.
- Understand the basic principles and applications of Automatic Text Recognition.
- Prepare your journey through the ATR pipeline by using our roadmap "How to get started in ATR?"
- Prepare to integrate ATR technology into your research activities effectively.
