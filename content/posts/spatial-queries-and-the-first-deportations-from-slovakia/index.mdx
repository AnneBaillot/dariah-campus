abstract: This practically oriented blog describes the process of analysis and
  the approaches as well as tools used and shows how a spatially enabled
  database can be made useful in the research process in the humanities. While
  none of the steps described is path-breaking from the technological point of
  view, the described workflow seems to be rarely, if at all, used by Holocaust
  historians.

As a part of my research on the history of refugee no man’s land at the end of the 1930s in East-Central Europe, I examined the deportations of Jews from Slovakia in November 1938, many of whom were subsequently trapped along the demarcation line between the Czecho-Slovak and Hungarian posts. The little known and extremely chaotic deportations were ordered by the Slovak President Jozef Tiso who blamed Jewish influence for the [First Vienna Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Vienna_Award), an international arbitration which forced (Czecho-)Slovakia to cede southern Slovakia to Hungary.[](https://blog.ehri-project.eu/2019/12/12/spatial-queries-first-deportations-slovakia/#en-3886-1)

For my paper given at the Lessons & Legacies in Munich, in November 2019, I wanted to better understand the background and migration trajectories of the approx. four thousand Jews picked for deportation. Given the dearth of information on the decision making on the local level, I hoped that the surviving lists of deportees will provide insights into who and why was targeted, at a moment’s notice. What kind of knowledge did the local officials apply to recognize “alien” Jews? Particularly important for my analysis was to establish the citizenship of those who were deported. Were they citizens of Hungary, in the new borders, or of other states? How many were stateless? And how many Czechoslovak citizens were put on trucks and sent towards the Hungarian border?

To answer such questions, we have digitised lists kept in the [Slovak National Archives](https://portal.ehri-project.eu/institutions/sk-003250) and compiled a database of the deportees containing information about their birth places, domicile and/or citizenship and place from which they were deported.

## L﻿earning outcomes

A﻿fter viewing this training resource, users will be able to:

- Recognise the benefit of using Geonames (or any similar resource) and spatial queries - with place coordinates, historical borders and spatial queries - to ask any new research questions or rephrase existing ones throughout the research process
- Learn how these standardisation can also make the building of visualisations (e.g. in the form of maps) much smoother
- Understand how visualisations can reveal connections and patterns that otherwise would remain invisible and hence feed back into the research process
