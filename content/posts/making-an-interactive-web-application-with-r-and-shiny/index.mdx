abstract: This lesson demonstrates how to build a basic interactive web
  application using Shiny. Shiny is a library (a set of additional functions)
  for the programming language R. Its purpose is to facilitate the development
  of web applications, which allow a user to interact with R code using User
  Interface (UI) elements in a web browser, such as sliders, drop-down menus,
  and so forth. In the lesson, you will design and implement a simple
  application, consisting of a slider which allows a user to select a date
  range, which will then trigger some code in R, and display a set of
  corresponding points on an interactive map.

## Learning outcomes

After completing this lesson, you will be able to:

- Create a basic interactive Shiny application
- Understand the key layouts and design principles of the Shiny UI
- Use Shiny's 'reactive programming' to ‘listen’ for certain inputs, and understand how they are connected to outputs displayed in your app
