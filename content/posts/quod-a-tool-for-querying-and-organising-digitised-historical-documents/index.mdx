abstract: The archives of the International Tracing Service (ITS) in Bad
  Arolsen, Germany, which focus on the topics of wartime incarceration, forced
  labour, and liberated survivors, have among their holdings a collection of
  approximately 4.2 million images (photographs) of documents that have been
  rearranged without taking into account their provenance. This makes it
  difficult — or at least highly laborious — to determine, for example, to which
  subcollection an image originally belongs, or, conversely, to find documents
  from certain subcollections; or to organise the collections in certain ways.
  The usability of this collection can be improved significantly (i) by
  unlocking it, i.e., by making it machine-readable and thereby open to
  querying, and (ii) by organising it automatically. This blog post demonstrates
  how the former can be seen as a prerequisite for the latter, which is the
  harder task.

In this blog post we introduce a prototype tool for OCRing and querying digitised historical documents, quod, which can be used for organising large collections of such documents.The work described represents a proof of concept, where the feasibility of the idea is demonstrated.

## **Background**

The archives of the [International Tracing Service](https://www.its-arolsen.org/en/archives/) (ITS) in Bad Arolsen, Germany, which focus on the topics of wartime incarceration, forced labour, and liberated survivors, have among their holdings a collection of approximately 4.2 million images (photographs) of documents that have been rearranged without taking into account their provenance. This makes it difficult — or at least highly laborious — to determine, for example, to which subcollection an image originally belongs, or, conversely, to find documents from certain subcollections; or to organise the collections in certain ways — for instance, to separate all documents issued by institute A from those issued by institutes B, C, etc.

ITS has rearranged many of its collections following the needs of the tracing tasks. As a consequence it is relatively easy to search for names of persons in the collection. Yet, at the same time, due to the loss of provenance and context information it is hard to approach the collections with other questions. In the example looked at for this project, for example, it would be very relevant and helpful, both for internal reasons as for researchers outside the ITS, to be able to define employers of forced labourers and even arrange the collections according to these.
