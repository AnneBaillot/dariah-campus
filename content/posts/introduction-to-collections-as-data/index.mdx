abstract: he goal of this course is to introduce the Collections as Data
  principles in the context of GLAM (Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums)
  and to analyse the different aspects to consider when making available a
  digital collection suitable for computational use. In order to do so, the
  course will cover a selection of relevant facets to publish collections as
  data such as providing a licence, terms of use, documentation and examples of
  use, or using a platform to make available the collection. At the end of this
  course, students will have a fundamental understanding of the complexities of
  Collections as Data as well as an appreciation of the diversity of the content
  provided by GLAM institutions. This lesson will be useful for anyone wishing
  to improve their knowledge about Collections as Data as well as small and
  medium-sized GLAM institutions willing to make available their digital
  collections suitable for computational use. Additionally, it will provide
  Collections as Data examples provided by relevant institutions.
