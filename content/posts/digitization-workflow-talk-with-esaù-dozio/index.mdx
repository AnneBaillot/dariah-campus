Esaù has a background in classical archeology and is responsible for special exhibitions and for the vase collection, he works as a curator at the Antikenmuseum Basel.



Form a curator’s view:

Is Digitalization a must, the whole world is digital - if you can see every sneaker from all sides, so you should also be able to guard valuable artifacts from all sides?

As a winning project of the Dariah Theme Call 2022-2024 on Workflows, we evaluated a showcase project called “curiositas5.0”, initiated by the Digitales Schaudepot Association (DSD) it is intended to assist in planning projects and, above all, avoiding unwanted missteps. Keep in mind that each project is distinct and may necessitate alternative measures.

To capture voices from the community and provide insight into the different working methods, expertise, and backgrounds of the people collaborating on the curiositas5.0 project, we conducted interviews. Here you find the talk with Esaù Dozio (Background in classical archeology, responsible for special exhibitions and for the vase collection, works as a curator at the Antikenmuseum Basel).
