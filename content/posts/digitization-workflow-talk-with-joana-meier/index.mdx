As a winning project of the Dariah Theme Call 2022-2024 on Workflows, we evaluated a showcase project called “curiositas5.0”, initiated by the Digitales Schaudepot Association (DSD) intended to assist in planning projects and, above all, avoiding unwanted missteps. To capture voices from the community and provide insight into the different working methods, expertise, and backgrounds of the people collaborating on the curiositas5.0 project, we conducted 3 interviews.

**What does "curating data stories" mean from a technical and academic perspective?**  Jane Haller, a sociologist, digital project manager, and president of the Digitales Schaudepot, is in conversation with Joana Meier. Joana holds a BA in Sociology and English Literature, is a Master's student in Digital Humanities, and works in museum education and digitization.
