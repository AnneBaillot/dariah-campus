Photogrammetry is a technique that transforms photographs into high-quality 3D data, and itâ€™s used in various fields such as archaeology, civil engineering, film production, and game development. The tutorial guides users through the process of preparing an object for a photogrammetry scan, capturing photos, and using Kiri Engine to create a 3D model. The tutorial emphasizes the importance of the quality and quantity of photos in creating a high-quality 3D model. It also highlights the significant implications of photogrammetry in the humanities field, particularly in the preservation of historical and cultural artifacts.

**Learning Outcomes**

After using this resource, learners will be able to:

**Use Photogrammetry**: You will understand that photogrammetry is a scientific method used to interpret and measure from photographs. It allows the capture of the physical properties of an object or a scene in the form of high-quality 3D data using just a camera.

**Use Kiri Engine**: You will learn how to use Kiri Engine to upload photos, perform 3D reconstruction, review and edit the 3D model, and export the model in various formats.

**Practically apply photogrammetry**: You will be able to prepare an object for a photogrammetry scan, including considerations for lighting, background, object placement, camera settings, image capture, and consistency.

**Understand the implications of Photogrammetry**: You will understand the significant implications of photogrammetry for the field of humanities, including the detailed capture and preservation of historical artifacts, architectural structures, and cultural heritage sites.
