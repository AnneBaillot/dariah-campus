  This course provides a comprehensive understanding of Europeana as a digital
  platform through a walkthrough of the Application Programming Interfaces
  (APIs) it offers. It provides the knowledge and skills to understand the
  functionality of these APIs, the purpose they serve and the functionality they
  have, in order to exploit them by formulating efficient queries for cultural
  heritage information retrieval. Building on the use cases introduced in
  “Introduction to Cultural Heritage Data” course and the data structure
  introduced in “Introduction to Cultural Heritage Data Modelling - with a focus
  on EDM” course, it delves into the APIs that are required to achieve such
  goals, exploring their features and providing familiarisation with supported
  data formats.


  Learning outcomes


  Upon completion of this course, participants will: 

  - have an understanding of Europeana APIs and the purpose each one serves; 

  - understand the use of the API key; 

  - be able to search and retrieve information by efficiently formulating queries and handling responses; 

  - be familiarised with the responses formats;

  - understand the functionality of selected APIs and exploit their features.

## Introduction

The [Europeana](https://www.europeana.eu/) platform is designed to provide access to millions of cultural heritage items, including books, music, artworks, videos, newspapers, from a wide range of European institutions, such as archives, libraries, and museums. It serves as a rich resource for researchers, academics, educators, other professionals, as well as  the general public, promoting knowledge of Europe’s cultural heritage and facilitating the discovery, use and reuse of data.  In an attempt to support its users and facilitate access to its vast resources, Europeana offers a variety of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). An API is a mechanism that allows software components to communicate with one another according to a set of predefined rules and protocols. Generally, APIs are software-independent, meaning they are not restricted to a specific application or platform. [Europeana currently offers 10 APIs](https://europeana.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EF/pages/2385313793/Europeana+APIs+Documentation) to assist developers in building applications that use the wealth of its collections. In this course, we provide the knowledge and skills to utilise these APIs, guided by the activities of Prof. Lorena, a persona introduced in course "Introduction to Cultural Heritage Data".    

Prof. Lorena holds the position of Professor of Social History in the Department of History at a university. Her area of expertise lies in the analysis of migration patterns, with a particular focus on investigating through her academic research the treatment of refugees in Europe. Over the past 7 years, she has been teaching courses such as “Migration and Diaspora in History”. Currently, she is investigating the impact of historical conflicts on migration, including both the identification of migration patterns and the reception of refugees in European countries. 



In her research, Prof. Lorena aims to collect diverse types of data, ranging from documents and photographs to newspaper articles and other historical materials. Motivated by the ongoing refugee crisis in southern Europe, she is currently exploring conflicts such as the Hungarian Revolution and the Greek/Turkish conflict. Additionally, she is supervising a Master’s thesis that has just started titled “Influence of the Hungarian Revolution on the Migration Pattern” by Costis, a graduate student in the Department of History, who is currently lacking extensive experience in digital tools and methods. Although Prof. Lorena has acquired experience in utilising digital methods through her extensive research in the domain of cultural heritage, she also does not consider herself an expert user.

Prof. Lorena has been using the [Europeana Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)](https://apis.europeana.eu/en) to collect data for her research on historical conflicts for sometime and is now focusing on the Hungarian Revolution. She introduces the variety of existing APIs to Costis so that he can exploit them to carry on his thesis. She highlights that using these APIs results in retrieving high-quality data structured according to the [Europeana Data Model (EDM)](https://pro.europeana.eu/page/edm-documentation#:~:text=The-,EDM%20Definition,-is%20the%20formal)—introduced in the “Introduction to Cultural Heritage Data Modelling — with a focus on EDM” course—allowing him to integrate new data into his existing datasets.
