  This course provides a comprehensive understanding of Europeana as a digital
  platform through a walkthrough of the Application Programming Interfaces
  (APIs) it offers. It provides the knowledge and skills to understand the
  functionality of these APIs, the purpose they serve and the functionality they
  have, in order to exploit them by formulating efficient queries for cultural
  heritage information retrieval. Building on the use cases introduced in the
  “Introduction to Cultural Heritage Data” course, it delves into the APIs that
  are required to achieve such goals, exploring their features and providing
  familiarisation with supported data formats.

## Introduction

[Europeana](https://www.europeana.eu/) is designed to provide access to millions of cultural heritage items, including books, music, artworks, videos, newspapers, and more, from a wide range of European institutions, such as galleries, archives, libraries, and museums. It serves as a rich resource for researchers, academics, educators, professionals, and the general public, facilitating the discovery, use and reuse of Europe's rich cultural history. Europeana's mission is to empower the cultural heritage sector in its digital transformation, also by promoting the sharing of knowledge. It does not only preserve digital representations of historical artefacts, but also shares them and makes them accessible to everyone, fostering a deeper understanding and dissemination of the rich European cultural heritage.
