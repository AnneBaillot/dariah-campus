  This course provides a comprehensive understanding of Europeana as a digital
  platform through a walkthrough of the Application Programming Interfaces
  (APIs) it offers. It provides the knowledge and skills to understand the
  functionality of these APIs, the purpose they serve and the functionality they
  have, in order to exploit them by formulating efficient queries for cultural
  heritage information retrieval. Building on the use cases introduced in
  “Introduction to Cultural Heritage Data” course and the data structure
  introduced in “Introduction to Cultural Heritage Data Modelling - with a focus
  on EDM” course, it delves into the APIs that are required to achieve such
  goals, exploring their features and providing familiarisation with supported
  data formats.

## Introduction

The [Europeana](https://www.europeana.eu/) platform is designed to provide access to millions of cultural heritage items, including books, music, artworks, videos, newspapers, from a wide range of European institutions, such as archives, libraries, and museums. It serves as a rich resource for researchers, academics, educators, other professionals, as well as  the general public, promoting knowledge of Europe’s cultural heritage and facilitating the discovery, use and reuse of data.  In an attempt to support its users and facilitate access to its vast resources, Europeana offers a variety of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). An API is a mechanism that allows software components to communicate with one another according to a set of predefined rules and protocols. Generally, APIs are software-independent, meaning they are not restricted to a specific application or platform. [Europeana currently offers 10 APIs](https://europeana.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EF/pages/2385313793/Europeana+APIs+Documentation) to assist developers in building applications that use the wealth of its collections. In this course, we provide the knowledge and skills to utilise these APIs, guided by the activities of Prof. Lorena, a persona introduced in course "Introduction to Cultural Heritage Data".    

Prof. Lorena holds the position of Professor of Social History in the Department of History at a university. Her area of expertise lies in the analysis of migration patterns, with a particular focus on investigating through her academic research the treatment of refugees in Europe. Over the past 7 years, she has been teaching courses such as “Migration and Diaspora in History”. Currently, she is investigating the impact of historical conflicts on migration, including both the identification of migration patterns and the reception of refugees in European countries. 

In her research, Prof. Lorena aims to collect diverse types of data, ranging from documents and photographs to newspaper articles and other historical materials. Motivated by the ongoing refugee crisis in southern Europe, she is currently exploring conflicts such as the Hungarian Revolution and the Greek/Turkish conflict. Additionally, she is supervising a Master’s thesis that has just started titled “Influence of the Hungarian Revolution on the Migration Pattern” by Costis, a graduate student in the Department of History, who is currently lacking extensive experience in digital tools and methods. Although Prof. Lorena has acquired experience in utilising digital methods through her extensive research in the domain of cultural heritage, she also does not consider herself an expert user.

Prof. Lorena has been using the [Europeana Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)](https://apis.europeana.eu/en) to collect data for her research on historical conflicts for sometime and is now focusing on the Hungarian Revolution. She introduces the variety of existing APIs to Costis so that he can exploit them to carry on his thesis. She highlights that using these APIs results in retrieving high-quality data structured according to the [Europeana Data Model (EDM)](https://pro.europeana.eu/page/edm-documentation#:~:text=The-,EDM%20Definition,-is%20the%20formal)—introduced in the “Introduction to Cultural Heritage Data Modelling — with a focus on EDM” course—allowing him to integrate new data into his existing datasets. 

During a recent conference that Costis attended, he met Dr. Anne, a professional working at a mid-sized European institution. Dr. Anne is specialised in Data Visualisation and Computational Analysis. She has a keen interest in migration studies and shows much interest in analysing and visualising the data Prof. Lorena and Costis are gathering. She believes that by bringing together their respective strengths and knowledge, they could produce a collaborative study that contributes to both academic scholarship and public discourse on migration and cultural heritage. This collaboration would not only be beneficial for their individual research, but could also foster a dynamic academic community dedicated to exploring historical narratives through innovative digital methodologies.

Costis considers the exploitation of Europeana APIs as a great opportunity to enhance the historical information related to his research topic and to collaborate with Dr. Anne using an even richer dataset. Besides data enrichment, this will also help him develop digital literacy skills. The Europeana APIs can be used for both advancing academic research and preparing the next generation of historians.

# An overview of Europeana APIs

Prof. Lorena guides Costis through the Europeana APIs, explaining how each one addresses specific research needs and enables developers and whoever wants  to use them to programmatically access and utilise the wealth of Europeana’s digital collections. These APIs provide a structured and efficient way to search for, retrieve, analyse, use and reuse cultural heritage data. The complete list of [Europeana APIs](https://europeana.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EF/pages/2461270026/API+Suite) currently includes:

1. **_Record API_**: allows direct access to the metadata of specific cultural heritage items, and available digital representations of the items.
2. **_Search API_**: allows searching across the metadata of all items and retrieves the ones that match a specified criteria.
3. **_Entity API_**: allows searching and retrieving information about named entities (e.g. Leonardo da Vinci, Mona Lisa, Florence, 16th century) referenced by items included in Europeana. An entity in this context may be a person, a topic, a place, time period, or an (data providing) organisation. 
4. **_IIIF APIs_**: following the specifications of the [International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) consortium](https://iiif.io/community/consortium/), this set of APIs includes: 

   a. _Presentation API_ for retrieving IIIF representation of the item ready for display, 

   b. _Content Search API_ for searching within the full-text content of the item, 

   c. _IIIF Image API_ for accessing images made available by content providers, and 

   d. _IIIF Full text API_ for accessing full text such as transcriptions, translations, captions and subtitles.
5. **_Annotation API_**: allows searching, retrieving, and contributing annotations about items.
6. **_User Set API_**: allows the creation and maintenance of sets of items that are hosted on Europeana.eu. Users can create sets and choose to make them publicly available (or not).
7. **_Recommendation API_**: utilises machine learning to compute similarity between Europeana resources, providing recommendations to users based on other resources (items, users sets, etc.).
8. **_SPARQL_**: allows users to query Europeana.eu and explore connections with external sources using [SPARQL](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/), a [W3C](https://www.w3.org/) recommendation query language for querying semantic data expressed in [RDF](https://www.w3.org/RDF/).  
9. **_OAI-PMH_**: allows metadata harvesting using the [Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH)](https://www.openarchives.org/pmh/). 
10. **_Thumbnail API_**: allows access to cached thumbnails generated during the aggregation of items in Europeana.

Costis takes note of the Europeana APis landing page (illustrated in Fig. 1) and learns from Prof. Lorena that before he starts using them, he needs to obtain an API key.

# Europeana API Key

An API key is a unique identifier that is used to offer software applications (or individual users) access to an API. In the context of Europeana, the API key is used to gather relevant statistics about the usage of the API, with the goal of further improving the APIs and facilitating customer support. When used in combination with the API key secret, it protects the API from unauthorised usage and limits access only to authorised users. 

Enthusiastic to fully utilise the Europeana APIs, Costis follows Prof. Lorena’s suggestion to obtain an API key. He finds the process straightforward, as it includes clear and easy-to-follow steps. He first navigates to the [Europeana webpage](https://pro.europeana.eu/page/get-api) where he can  request an API key. There, he fills out a form, providing basic information about his identity, the organisation he is affiliated with and his sector of activity. After submitting his request, he automatically receives his personal API key via email. 

Lacking previous experience with Europeana APIs, Costis doesn’t realise that his API key belongs only to him and should not be shared with others.. Prof. Lorena stresses the importance of keeping it private as it could lead to unauthorised use. With this understanding, Costis can now efficiently access and explore Europeana.eu, gathering data for his thesis on the Hungarian Revolution’s impact on migration. This requires hands-on experience that  can improve his digital literacy. The [Europeana APIs documentation](https://europeana.atlassian.net/wiki/x/JIAzjg) will help him make progress.

Prof. Lorena explains to Costis that when using Europeana's API suite, he needs to provide his API key to gain access. Traditionally, he could do this by adding a parameter named 'wskey' to his requests, as described [here](https://europeana.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EF/pages/2462351393/Accessing+the+APIs#Registration). However, this option is being deprecated and replaced by alternative methods, including specific browser configuration. Following the instructions provided [here](https://europeana.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EF/pages/2358673409/How+to+set+up+your+browser+to+access+the+Europeana+APIs), he sets up his browser with his API key. It is strongly recommended that interested readers request their own API key and configure their browsers using the same instructions. For demonstration purposes of this course only, the API key 'manspaste' can be used.

# Requests & Responses

Based on the guidance he has received so far from Prof. Lorena, Costis understands that exploiting the Europeana APIs can facilitate the discovery and retrieval of valuable information. However, achieving this goal requires formulating efficient queries. A crucial step for Costis is to understand the query syntax. Prof. Lorena explains that Europeana APIs use standard [Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) methods](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html) such as GET and POST,  along with parameters that refine searches. HTTP is a protocol that implements a request-response interaction between a client and a server. 

<SideNote type="note">
According to the HTTP GET method, a user (client) sends a request (query) to a server (Europeana API), and the server (Europeana API) sends a response (query result) back to the client (user). The POST method works similarly, but instead of retrieving a response from the server, it aims to create or update a resource on the server’s side.
</SideNote>

These requests and updates are further specified using parameters. In the case of Europeana APIs, these parameters include specific keywords, subjects, dates, location, and other metadata types, along with the API key, which is also defined within the query as a parameter. 

Queries are made to Europeana APIs by using a web browser and formulating the correct query in its address bar. Taking the [Europeana APIs documentation](https://europeana.atlassian.net/wiki/x/JIAzjg) as a reference point, Costis starts exploring the Search API under the guidance of Prof. Lorena. She highlights that every call to this API is structured by first entering the following **base URL**:

```http
https://api.europeana.eu/record/v2/search.json
```



This URL must include the mandatory “query” parameter for the query formulation. and “wskey” for the API key. This parameters is inserted directly after the base URL, separated by a question mark (?) from the base URL, while additional parameters can be included, separated by an ampersand (&). Costis decides to query the Search API for the keyword “Hungarian revolution”, formulated as follows:

```http
https://api.europeana.eu/record/v2/search.json?query=Hungarian+Revolution 
```

Failure to correctly configure the browser using his API key would result in an unsuccessful query, generating the JSON response illustrated in Fig. 2. 

<Figure src="images/yourkey.png">
Fig. 2: JSON response of unsuccessful query due to invalid API key
</Figure>

The parameters that can be used to refine the query (query conditions) are primarily derived from EDM metadata fields. Thanks to his familiarity with EDM, Costis refines his query to retrieve results only of the type “image”:

```http
https://api.europeana.eu/record/v2/search.json?query=Hungarian+Revolution&type=image
```

Using parameters supports query refinement by specifying conditions which must be met. This allows Costis to filter out results that are not relevant to his research interest, such as those referring to different historical periods. Logical or Boolean operators, like AND, OR, and NOT, can also be exploited to combine different conditions or filters. For instance, the previous query returns all the records containing either the string “Hungarian” or the string “Revolution” or both. Using the Boolean operator AND, Costis can refine the search to retrieve the records containing both strings, as follows:

```
https://api.europeana.eu/record/v2/search.json?query=Hungarian+AND+Revolution
```
