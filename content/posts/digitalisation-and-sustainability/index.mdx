Digitalisation has been one of the most talked about and evolving concepts of the 21st century, with promises of bringing great new solutions to the world. However, the process of digitalisation is quickly becoming one of the biggest offenders against the goal of sustainability. Overtime, several calls from environmental activists as well as nowadays governments have urged the digitalisation experts to think of not only how to improve the world by providing new solutions via Internet and technology, but to consider how this can impact the natural world we live in. As resources are finite and tech-waste comes into play, Daria Gritsenko from University of Helsinki ponders over how to potentially improve sustainability within the area of digitalisation.
