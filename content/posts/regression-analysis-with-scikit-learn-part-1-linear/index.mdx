abstract: This lesson is the first of a two-part lesson focusing on an
  indispensable set of data analysis methods, logistic and linear regression. It
  provides an overview of linear regression and walks through running both
  algorithms in Python (using Scikit-learn). The lesson also discusses
  interpreting the results of a regression model and some common pitfalls to
  avoid.
