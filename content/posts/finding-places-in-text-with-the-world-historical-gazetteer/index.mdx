abstract: Researchers often need to be able to search a corpus of texts for a
  defined list of terms and historians are often interested in certain places
  named in a text or texts. This lesson details how to programmatically search
  documents for a list of terms, including place names and then how to obtain
  coordinates and map historical place names with the World Historical
  Gazetteer.
