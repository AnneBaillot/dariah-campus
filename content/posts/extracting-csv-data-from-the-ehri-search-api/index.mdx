abstract: The EHRI (European Holocaust Research Infrastructure) Search API
  provides a way of retrieving information about items in the EHRI portal in
  JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format by making HTTP requests to particular
  URLs. Instead of using a web browser to make web requests which return HTML
  pages, we use a command line tool (CuRL) that fetches structured data we can
  then transform into CSV (comma separated values), a format we can then import
  into a spreadsheet like Excel or Google Docs.

This tutorial shows you how to use some popular command-line tools (available on MacOS, Linux, and Windows) to extract data from the EHRI Search API and convert it to CSV, where it can be imported into Excel or a relational database. The tools we will be using are as follows:

- [Curl](https://curl.haxx.se/) - a tool for making HTTP(S) requests from the command line
- [Jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) - a tool for processing and transforming JSON data in various ways

Both Curl and Jq are available on various platforms, but precise details of usage may vary depending on the version and platform. This guide will assume you're using a system with a standard Unix-like shell (such as Bash), standard on MacOS or Linux and available on Windows in various forms such as [WSL](https://itsfoss.com/install-bash-on-windows/) or [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/).
