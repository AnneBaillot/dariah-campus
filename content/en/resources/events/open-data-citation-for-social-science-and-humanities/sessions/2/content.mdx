## Abstract

*Research data management planning: a chance for Open Science. Methods and tutorials to create a Data Management Plan*

With the growth of the Open Science movement in the past few years, researchers have been increasingly encouraged by their home institutions, their funders, and by the public, to share the data they produce. A new model of data sharing is emerging, and this issue is becoming more and more crucial for the scientific community and for national and international research policy. As shown by the [OECD in 2007](http://www.oecd.org/science/sci-tech/38500813.pdf), public granting agencies hope that publicly funded research projects would give access to the data produced within their work, in order to provide new resources for economic development. And with the extension of the Open Research Data Pilot in Horizon 2020, H2020 beneficiaries have to make their research data "[findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR)](http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/grants_manual/hi/oa_pilot/h2020-hi-oa-data-mgt_en.pdf)", and are therefore asked to provide a Data Management Plan (or DMP) to this end.

More than a constraint, this new model of openness brings direct benefits for researchers. Sharing their data allows the researchers to organise and retrieve them effectively, to ensure their security, to collaborate with fellow researchers within the same discipline or from other disciplines, to reduce costs by avoiding duplication of data collection, to make easier validation of results, to increase the impact and visibility of their research outputs.

<Speakers>
  **Marie Puren** and **Charles Riondet**, Ph.D., are junior researchers in Digital Humanities at the French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation ([INRIA](https://www.inria.fr/en)) in Paris, members of the [Alpage laboratory](https://www.rocq.inria.fr/alpage-wiki/tiki-index.php?page=Accueil) (INRIA â€“ Paris Diderot University). As collaborators to the [PARTHENOS](http://www.parthenos-project.eu/) H2020 project, they focus their research on the development of standards for data management and research tools in Arts and Humanities, and they currently work on the creation of a Data Management Plan for this project.
