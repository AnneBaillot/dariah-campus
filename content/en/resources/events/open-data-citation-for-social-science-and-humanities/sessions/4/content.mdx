## Open peer review & Open commentary: about an experiment: Julien Bordier

### Abstract

*Open peer review & Open commentary: about an experiment.*

For five months, the OA journal Vertigo experimented both open peer review and open commentary devices within its scientific blog. While the first consisted strictly in opening a classical pre-publication review process, the second was inviting the whole "scientific community" to comment pre-publications in order to improve them before submission. In both of the two devices, every reviews, comments and annotations are accessible to everyone online, as the authors, reviewers and commentators names. The sociologist in charge of this project will present the details of the experiment, its main results – need of human mediation, technical possibilities and limitations – and will try to raise the questions and potentialities issued by new forms of reviewing in academic publishing.

## Simplifying license selection: Ondřej Košarko

### Abstract

*Simplifying license selection.*

The necessity to share and preserve data and software is becoming more and more important. Without the data and the software, research cannot be reproduced and tested by the scientific community. Making data and software simply reusable and legally unequivocal requires choosing a license for data and software which is not a trivial task.

## European Network for Research Evaluation in the Social Sciences and Humanities: Ioana Galleron

### Abstract

*Data informed research evaluation: challenges of data collection and data standardisation in the SSH.*

Evaluation has always been perceived as a difficult area for the SSH for a number of reasons. One of the problems is the fact that the most common procedures have been fine-tuned to the so-called hard sciences and as such are ill adapted the SSH disciplines. While abundant information exists about research practices, disciplinary biases and dissemination traditions in STEM fields, the situation is at least contrasted between Nordic and Southern countries with regards to the monitoring of the research production/outputs in SSH disciplines. This presentation will briefly introduce the [COST Action CA15137](http://enressh.eu/), dedicated to the creation of a network of evaluators for the SSH disciplines, then will focus on the needs and the challenges of data collection for an informed peer evaluation of the SSH.
