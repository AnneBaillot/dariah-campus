### Abstract

*Research Data Dissemination And Preservation: A Vision From Huma-Num, A French Infrastructure Dedicated To Humanities.*

In the field of Humanities and Social Sciences, the production of digital or scanned data has increased considerably in recent years. These data, which are usually very expensive to produce, are often lost at the end of the project. They are therefore rarely reused, due to a lack of financial, human and technical resources of the communities that produced them. This talk will present the general approach, both technical and educational, used by Huma-Num infrastructure to address these issues.
