## Economic Models for Open Access Publications: Pierre Mounier

### Abstract

*Economic models for Open Access publications*

The development of open access in humanities and social sciences faces a major challenge: sustainability. Whereas in STM disciplines, the new dissemination paradigm means shifting from reader-pays model to author-pays model, the infamous "APC", in humanities and social sciences that type of reconfiguration is simply not possible for many good reasons. Moreover, the dissemination of knowledge in those disciplines is mostly done through books and not solely in journals, which entails additional complications. Therefore, those who want to develop open access in SSH have to find their own solution, that fits with their specific ecosystem. Whether it be based on donations, grants, subscriptions, in kind contributions, crowdfunding or "freemium" model, the are many ongoing experimentations under development. A landscape of the different models and the main trends on the topic will be presented.

## Repository-as-a-Service: An Experimental Model for the Sustainable Curation and Funding of Large Niche Corpora in the Humanities: Patrick Flack

### Abstract

*Repository-as-a-Service: An Experimental Model for the Sustainable Curation and Funding of Large Niche Corpora in the Humanities.*

sdvig press is a non-profit academic publishing platform dedicated to supporting the dissemination and linking of knowledge in the Humanities between Eastern, Central and Western Europe. One of its central mission is to give visibility and provide structured access to large corpora of texts from Russia, Poland, the Czech Republic or the Baltic states, relating in particular to important epistemological paradigms of the Humanities such as structuralism, phenomenology, or critical theory. This objective implies not only the high-quality digitisation of textual sources, but also their translation at least into English. Given the still obscure nature of these corpora, however, it is hard to find anything more than punctual funding, and there is no prospect of even mild commercial success to finance these tasks in the systematic, long-term perspective that they require.

The solution explored by sdvig press is the development of thematic platforms that integrate Central and Eastern European corpora into better defined, more visible and more international contexts. We are developing three prototypes, of which the Open Commons of Phenomenology is the most advanced (the other two are [Structuralica](http://structuralica.org/) and [Pacem](http://pacem.io/)). Each of these platforms, at first, is conceived mainly as an exhaustive bio-bibliographical repository providing structured access (ideally) to all sources and references in its thematic field. Access to contents is wholly unrestricted, but a number of tools (advance search, lists, visualisations, etc.) are made available only to libraries through a subscription.
