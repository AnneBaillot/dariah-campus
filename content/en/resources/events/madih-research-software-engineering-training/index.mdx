## An Open Access synthesis of the RSE Training workshop for MaDiH project

The purpose of the workshop was to introduce best practices in Research Software Engineering and the Software Engineering Lifecycle (SDLC) adopted at King's Digital Lab. The target audience of the workshop was members of the team of the AHRC-funded "MaDiH: Mapping the Digital Cultural Heritage in Jordan".
