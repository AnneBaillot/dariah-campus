How do we design infrastructure that connects? This panel discusses collaborative platforms, partnerships between research and cultural sectors, and libraries as labs. It features presentations by Seb Chan — Chief Experience Officer, Australian Centre for the Moving Image and Dr Marie-Louise Ayres — Director General, National Library of Australia.

The session was filmed during the Humanities, Arts and Culture Data Summit and 3rd DARIAH beyond Europe workshop, held at the National Library of Australia, Canberra, in March 2019. The workshop is part of a series of three-day workshops organised in the context of the DARIAH-DESIR project in 2018 and 2019, in the US and Australia, allowing an exchange of ideas between the DARIAH community and Digital Arts & Humanities projects in this international context.
