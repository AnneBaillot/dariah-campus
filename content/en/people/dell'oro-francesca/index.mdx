Francesca Dell'Oro is SNSF assistant professor of diachronic linguistics at the University of Lausanne and the PI of the WoPoss SNSF project on modalisation paths in the Latin language. She is a historical linguist with a strong interest in semantics. Her research and expertise spans from the linguistic analysis of ancient documents in their material context and the epistemological analysis of key concepts in the history of linguistics to the development of complementary methods which combine computational tools and philological expertise.
